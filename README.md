# Post Listings Row Actions Toggle Plugin

This is a simple WordPress plugin that makes some minor changes to the post/page listing in the WordPress administrative area.

By default, the row actions links ('Edit', 'Quick Edit', 'Trash', 'Preview') can only be viewed after hover over the post/page row. In an effort to improve accessibility to those that navigate the web using keyboards only, this plugin creates a toggle link hides and reveals the row actions.
